# Problem Overview 

I was required to build a SSO server that can be used by different applications. 
The Idea of having multiple applications from the same device use a secret token 
generated by oauth2 that will confirm a session exists for a user and log them in
other applications if need be. 

# Challenges faced

Generating a local token for a user using oauth0 with python-flask presented a 
problem as I have not dealt with oAuth2, it was simpler due to availability of 
resources to create a token using established providers like google and twitter 
but for a username and password approach i found it hard to execute. 

# Current state of project

The project has endpoints to login a user in and store their session, logout and
delete their session, register a new user and change the password of a user. 
it can check if the user exists and check if their password is correct. 

# Technical Requirements to run Application
- Python3
# How to set up Application locally
1: Clone the repo
2: in the root directory of the repo run: 
-`pip3 install'
# How to run
from the directory run: 
- `python3 app.py'


# How to test application
while running the application. you may user postman or a similar tool to check 
the endpoints of the API. 

the application will (by default) run on https://localhost:5000 
ENDPOINTS:

/login - this needs to be submitted with a form data that has the keys username 
and password

/register - this needs to be submitted with a form data that has the keys 
username and password and will create a new user on the database

/change-password/<username> - this needs a variable of the user in the url and 
form data of the new password with the password key as password

/check-auth/<username> this needs a variable of the username in the url to check
 if the user is logged in.. it will return 200 if the user is logged in
